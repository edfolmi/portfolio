# 👨‍💻 Ephraim (Folmi) Daniel — Portfolio Website

This is my **personal portfolio website** built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**.  
It represents my work as a **Python Developer | API & Backend Engineer**, and showcases my projects, skills, and experience.

## 🧭 About This Project

This portfolio was designed to be:
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight** (Vite + React)
- 💎 **Clean and minimal** (Tailwind CSS + modular components)
- 🧩 **Scalable and maintainable** (TypeScript, Context API/Zustand)
- 🧠 **Structured professionally** for clarity and extensibility

It’s not just a portfolio — it’s a reflection of **software engineering discipline**.
